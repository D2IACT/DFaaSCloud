# DFaaSCloud
A toolkit for simulation of Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) in a geo-distributed computing mode. 
The simulation toolkit enables users to define FaaS functions with various characteristics and 
service level objectives (SLOs), place them across geo-distributed cloud servers, and evaluate per-function performance.
