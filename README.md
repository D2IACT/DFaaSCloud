# DFaaSCloud
A toolkit for simulation of Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) in a geo-distributed computing mode. 
The simulation toolkit enables users to define FaaS functions with various characteristics and 
service level objectives (SLOs), place them across geo-distributed cloud servers, and evaluate per-function performance. 

In 2019 December we will release DFaaSCloud to the public. 
The code will be available at here, where users can find detailed instructions for installing DFaaSCloud.
